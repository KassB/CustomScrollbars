## How do I use these on my website ?
 You have **three options** :
 1. **Download the scrollbar.css** file that you want and add it to your websites folder then link to it in the head of your **HTML**. Example : 
     ```html
        <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="scrollbar-Moonlight.css" type="text/css">
        </head>
    ```
    change the href name to the name of the scrollbar css file you downloaded. You can put this above or below your other style sheets in the head of your html.

2. Copy and paste the scrollbar .css files contents and add to your existing css.

3. **The Quickest way** : just copy the corrosponding link from the Links.txt file in this repository and paste it into the head of your html file and vola.
